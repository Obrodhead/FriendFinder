Cartoon Friend finder:

Description:
The friend finder app is an interactive application that returns cartoon characters as cartoon friends.

Functionality:
The user is prompted with a page to start the survey and it takes you to the survey page.
Then you must enter a name and a url for your profile picture.
You will then answer 10 questions. Each question is on a scale of 1-5, 1 being least likely to identify with the question, and 5 being most likely.

Answers are recorded and tried against the list of potential friends and it returns a card window with the best match.
